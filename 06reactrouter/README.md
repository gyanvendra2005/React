# REACT ROUTERS AND CONTEXT API

Welcome to a basic website built with React! 

## Overview of React Router aand Context api
- In this project I had learnt about React Routers and context API
- Befor context is designed we use to pass props in all components and we have to do props drilling to get access of  props  
  in a deep component.
- Context is designed to share data that can be considered “global” for a tree of React components, such as the current 
  authenticated user, theme, or preferred language.
- Every Context object comes with a Provider React component that allows consuming components to subscribe to context changes.

## Features of Project 
- There is toggle at the top which can be used to switch the mode of website
- The react-router-dom provides Link and Navlink which is used instead of anchor tag and it is effect as it provides several 
  features to the coders.
