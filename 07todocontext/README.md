# TODO BY CONTEXT


## About Context
-Befor context is designed we use to pass props in all components and we have to do props drilling to get access of props
 in a deep component.
-Context is designed to share data that can be considered “global” for a tree of React components, such as the current 
 authenticated user, theme, or preferred language.
-Every Context object comes with a Provider React component that allows consuming components to subscribe to context changes.
