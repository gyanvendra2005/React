# TAILWIND AND REACT PROPS
 => IN THIS PROJECT I HAD LEARNT ABOUT SOME BASICS OF TAILWIND AND REACT PROPS 

 - Props are arguments passed into React components.
 - Props are passed to components via HTML attributes.

## WHY NEED PROPS 
- IF WE ARE MAKING A SIMILAR CARD OR A COMPONENT IN WHICH ONLY SOME PARAMETERS LIKE: USERNAME, ID, PRODUCT NAME ARE DIFFERENT THEN BEFORE PROPS WE HAVE WRITE WHOLE CODE AGAIN AND CHANGE THE PARAMETERS
- BUT AFTER PROPS, WE CAN PASS ARGUMENTS VIA HTML ATTRIBUTES AND CAN ACCESS THE PROPS WHERE WE HAVE TO USE IT BY DESTRUCTING IT.
